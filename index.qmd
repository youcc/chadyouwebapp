Hi there!

I'm Chad You, Sr Database Administrator at [VUMC Health Policy](https://www.vumc.org/health-policy/welcome-health-policy), where I lead the Data Core team.

Professionaly, I love teaching healthcare analytics, researching digital health, and developing data solutions. 

If youâ€™ve found my blogs helpful and want to buy me a coffee or tea, feel free to contribute over at [ko-fi.com/chadyou](https://ko-fi.com/chadyou).

Outside of work, I love to practice Aikido at [Nashville Aikikai](https://nashvilleaikikai.org/).
