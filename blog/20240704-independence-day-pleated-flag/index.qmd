On July 4th, the United States celebrates Independence Day. Besides the American flag, one common decoration for this holiday is the half-circle flag shown below.

Iâ€™ve always wondered what this type of flag is called. After asking MS Copilot, I learned a new term: pleated flags.

Pleated flags, also known as bunting flags, are typically hung indoors or outdoors during festivals or celebrations for decorative purposes. Here are some general guidelines:

- **Design**: Pleated flags are usually half-circle or fan-shaped. They often feature a combination of red, white, and blue to resemble the American flag.

- **Usage**: They are commonly used during patriotic events, holidays, or celebrations, adding a festive touch to homes, businesses, and public spaces.

- **Material**: Pleated flags are typically made from lightweight, durable bunting fabric. Traditional materials include cotton or polyester.

- **Display**: When displaying half-circle flags:
    - Hang them vertically or horizontally.
    - Secure them properly to prevent sagging or twisting.
    - Avoid using them as actual flags on flagpoles; they are decorative items.
