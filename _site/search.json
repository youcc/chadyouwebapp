    "text": "On July 4th, the United States celebrates Independence Day. Besides the American flag, one common decoration for this holiday is the half-circle flag shown below.\n\nI‚Äôve always wondered what this type of flag is called. After asking MS Copilot, I learned a new term: pleated flags.\n\nPleated flags, also known as bunting flags, are typically hung indoors or outdoors during festivals or celebrations for decorative purposes. Here are some general guidelines:\n\nDesign: Pleated flags are usually half-circle or fan-shaped. They often feature a combination of red, white, and blue to resemble the American flag.\nUsage: They are commonly used during patriotic events, holidays, or celebrations, adding a festive touch to homes, businesses, and public spaces.\nMaterial: Pleated flags are typically made from lightweight, durable bunting fabric. Traditional materials include cotton or polyester.\nDisplay: When displaying half-circle flags:\n\nHang them vertically or horizontally.\nSecure them properly to prevent sagging or twisting.\nAvoid using them as actual flags on flagpoles; they are decorative items."
