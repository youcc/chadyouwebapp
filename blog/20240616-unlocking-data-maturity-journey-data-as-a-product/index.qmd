# **Unlocking Data Maturity: A Journey Toward Data-as-a-Product**

## **Introduction**

In the ever-evolving landscape of data management, the concept of the data mesh has gained significant traction. But how do organizations practically embark on this transformation? Olivier Wulveryck sheds light on a novel approach that combines evolutionary thinking with data maturity. Buckle up as we explore the path to treating data as a product!

## **The Four Pillars of Data Mesh**

1. **Domain-Oriented Design**: Start by aligning your data mesh with existing organizational structures. Think of it as laying the groundwork for a comprehensive understanding of your data landscape.

2. **Data-as-a-Product**: Imagine data as a tangible product, with clear ownership, quality standards, and value propositions. This mindset shift is crucial for successful data mesh adoption.

3. **Federated Computational Governance**: Simplify development by enabling self-service data platforms. These platforms empower teams to create interconnections seamlessly.

4. **Self-Service Data Platforms**: These platforms are enablers, supporting the data mesh vision. They allow teams to access, explore, and utilize data efficiently.

## **Applying Evolutionary Models to Data**

Drawing inspiration from Simon Wardley's evolution model, we visualize data maturity within a business context. Here's how it works:

1. **Data Acquisition**: Prepare data for easy utilization by Language Models (LLMs). Clean, structured data is the foundation.

2. **Transformation**: Convert data into a mathematical representation. Think of it as creating a bridge between raw data and actionable insights.

3. **Data Contracts**: Implement data contracts to ensure trust and seamless integration. Treat data like a valuable product with clear terms and conditions.

## **The Tipping Point**

When will your organization start reaping the benefits of data contracts and data-as-a-product? Look for that tipping pointâ€”the moment when data maturity unlocks efficiency, collaboration, and innovation.

Remember, the data mesh isn't just a buzzword; it's a strategic shift. So, embrace the evolution, treat data as your prized product, and watch your organization thrive!
